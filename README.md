<p align="justify">

Since I was little I always liked this game, I used to play with cards and although I always had to look for the same animals, that didn't make me like the game any less.

</p>
<p align="justify">

Today I would like to share with you my version of the game, I have made it using this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMhiMsEC9Uk&list=PLLX1I3KXZ-YH-woTgiCfONMya39-Ty8qw&index=4) and bringing a little bit of<span style="color:lime"> my magic</span>.

<h2 id="how"> (ﾉ´ヮ`)ﾉ*: ･ﾟ  What it is and how to play</h2>

<p align="justify">

The game consists of finding the pair of each image. Here is an example:

</p >

<img src="img/match.gif" width="400px" ></img>

<p align="justify">

What happens if they don't match? <strong>NOTHING</strong>, try again :sparkling_heart: No maximum attempts here.

</p>

<img src="img/notmatch.gif" width="400px" ></img>

<h2 id="fun"> \(<span style="color:gold">★</span>ω<span style="color:gold">★</span>)/   Fun stuff</h2>

<details open="open">
  <summary>We <span style="color:red"> LOVE </span> Fun ( click me )</summary>
<ul >
<li>If you have clicked on two images and they do not match, you cannot click again until they are rotated: <br> </br>  <img  src="img/dobleClick.gif" width="400px"> </img>  </li>

<li>

When you have finished, you will hear a [sound](https://soundbible.com/2157-Text-Message-Alert-4.html) and a button will be activated to start over.

A better understanding of how it works position [absolute](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFt_n4M9Vyk&ab_channel=CodeSketch).

</li>
<li>

[3D Effect](https://www.quackit.com/css/css3/properties/css_transform-style.cfm) for rotating images.

</li>
<li>

Use of [data](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Howto/Use_data_attributes) atributtes to know which image has been rotated and to know if they match

</li>

<li>

Random position of images: [IIFE](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/IIFE) so that the function is executed immediately once it has been declared and with [style.order](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/order) that will modify the position of the images, instead of having all of them in position 0 (it is by default) thanks to Math.floor(Math.random() \* 12) they have a number assigned up to 12 randomly.
